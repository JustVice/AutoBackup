hey there! :>
It's 1:05AM when I wrote this and I'm really tired.
I just finished coding version 1.0 ^-^
I should have done homework...
but I feel this is more important.
It's something that I like to do... something that makes me smile.
Something that does not feel like practice... something that I start doing just because... I like it.
It makes me feel.. good.
Idk if someone will read this one day. 
Just remember that your life is now. It's not tomorrow, or in some years. It's not
when you finish studiying or when you get a job... it is now.
